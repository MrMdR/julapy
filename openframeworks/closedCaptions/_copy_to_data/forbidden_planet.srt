In the final decade
of the 21st century...

3
00:01:33,777 --> 00:01:37,474
men and women in rocket ships
landed on the moon.

4
00:01:37,547 --> 00:01:42,246
By 2200 A.D., they had reached
the other planets of our solar system.

5
00:01:42,318 --> 00:01:45,481
Almost at once there followed
the discovery of hyper-drive...

6
00:01:45,555 --> 00:01:47,921
through which the speed of light
was first attained...

7
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:50,050
and later greatly surpassed.

8
00:01:50,126 --> 00:01:53,584
And so at last,
mankind began the conquest...

00:01:53,663 --> 00:01:56,257

to the planetary system of
the great main sequence star, Altair.

13
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:18,914

- Half a minute, Skipper.

14
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,153
Ship on course, sir.
We'll reach D.C. point at 1701.

That's less than three minutes now.

00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,860
- All right, take it away.
- Aye, aye, sir.

17
00:02:33,136 --> 00:02:36,128
Chief, we'll drop back below light speed
in about three minutes.

- Aye, aye, sir.

All right. Good.

20
00:02:42,612 --> 00:02:44,876
D.C. set and punched on, Skipper.

of any sort is required.

The red carpet treatment, huh?

92
00:08:56,219 --> 00:09:00,178
Dr. Morbius, my orders are to
survey the situation on Altair-4.

93
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:03,555
Let me repeat:
I'm in no sort of difficulty here.

94
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:07,960
Your best procedure will be to
turn back at once without landing.

95
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,463
Sorry, sir.

96
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:11,966
If you set down on this planet,
I warn you...

97
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:17,062
that I cannot be answerable for
the safety of your ship or your crew.

If you'll just supply me
with landing coordinates.

Dr. Morbius,
I require landing coordinates.

100
00:09:25,581 --> 00:09:29,881
Very well, but I wash my hands
of all responsibility.

101

- You have standard charts?
- Yes, sir.

could get used to this...

- Aye, aye, sir.

- Better check the command mike.
- Hmm?

- The command mike, sir.
- Oh, good idea.

- Sir?

with 187 other languages...

along with their various
dialects and sub-tongues.

138
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:29,251
Colloquial English
will do fine, thank you.

139
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:33,261
This is no offense,
but you are a robot, aren't you?

140
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,864
That is correct, sir.

to respond to the name "Robby."

Hey, Doc,
is it a male or a female?

146
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:03,358
In my case, sir, the question
is totally without meaning.

How ironic that a simple scholar
with no ambition...

157
00:15:42,057 --> 00:15:45,390
beyond a modest measure of seclusion,
should, out of a clear sky...

158
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:49,261
find himself besieged by
an army of fellow creatures...

all grimly determined
to be of service to him.

160
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:56,638
I'm sorry, sir, if we're not welcome,
but we do have our orders.

161
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:59,196
But you must stay
for lunch, gentlemen...

162
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:01,970
and do forgive the ill manners
of an old recluse.

163
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,978
Won't you come in?

164
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,655
Whatever that lunch was,
it was certainly delicious.

165
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,160
Simply some of Robby's synthetics.

- He's your cook too?
- Even manufactures the raw materials.

Come around here, Robby.

168
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,163
I'll show you how this works.

One introduces a sample of human food
through this aperture.

170
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:41,410
Here there's a small built-in chemical
laboratory where he analyzes it.

171
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:44,884
Later he can reproduce identical
molecules in any shape or quantity.

172
00:16:44,953 --> 00:16:48,389
Why, it's a housewife's dream.

173
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:50,948
Plus absolute selfless obedience.

Order cancelled.

Don't attribute feeling
to him, gentlemen.

180
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,316
Robby is simply a tool.
Tremendously strong, of course.

181
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:23,881
He could quite easily topple
this house off its foundation.

182
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,451
In the wrong hands, mightn't
such a tool become a deadly weapon?

183
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:31,659
No, Doctor, not even though I were the
mad scientist of the tape thrillers...

184
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:34,965
because, you see, there happens
to be a built-in safety factor.

185
00:17:35,037 --> 00:17:39,303
Commander, may I borrow that
formidable-Iooking side arm of yours?

00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:46,411
Thank you.

Yes, Morbius.
A simple blaster.

All right.
Now turn around here.

Point it at the commander.

If I were to allow

he would blow
every circuit in his body.

Doctor, how did you
come by such a mechanism?

203
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:01,117
Uh, I didn't
"come by" him, Doctor...

204

I tinkered him together
during my first months up here.

- Coffee is ready, sir.
- Gentlemen.

206

Doctor, do you mean that
you made this gentleman?

207

A useful enough toy, Lieutenant...

but nowadays I have
no time for such things.

Dr. Morbius, you're a philologist,

their origins and meanings.

Forgive me. I didn't mean
to alarm you, gentlemen.

218
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,943
I had Robby install
the steel shutters...

219
00:19:58,013 --> 00:20:00,914
before I realized how
altogether safe I am here.

[Beeping, Shutters Banging]

Well, gentlemen,
this has been very pleasant.

00:20:10,993 --> 00:20:13,291
You've seen how
comfortable I am here...

no hardships,
no special difficulties...

and no need at all
for military assistance.

00:20:20,002 --> 00:20:22,766
Now I daresay you're impatient
to get back to base.

226
00:20:22,838 --> 00:20:26,296
Yes, the moment we've interviewed the
other members of the Belerephon party.

227
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:31,406
Others. But there are
no others, Commander.

Before the first year was out,
they had all, every man and woman...

succumbed to a...
to a sort of a planetary force here...

230
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:42,985
some dark, terrible,
incomprehensible force.

231
00:20:43,058 --> 00:20:44,992
Only my wife and I were immune.

232
00:20:46,128 --> 00:20:48,995
And just how do you account
for your immunity, Dr. Morbius?

233
00:20:49,064 --> 00:20:53,262
We differed from the others only
in our special love for this world...

234
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,532
in our boundless longing
to make a home here...

235
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:59,802
far from the scurry
and strife of humankind.

236
00:21:01,276 --> 00:21:05,235
I remember how, when the vote
was taken to return to Earth...

237
00:21:05,314 --> 00:21:08,681
she and I were utterly heartbroken.

238
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,686
How could we have foreseen the
extinction of coworkers and friends?

239
00:21:14,323 --> 00:21:17,850
Skipper, there is no record of any wife
in the Belerephon rolls.

240
00:21:17,926 --> 00:21:21,453
Lieutenant, look under
"biochemistry," Julia Marsin.

241
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,397
She and I were married
by the skipper on the voyage here.

I have the certificate.

I thought Robby had managed some
very charming feminine touches.

I take it Mrs. Morbius
isn't at home today?

My dear wife died
a few months after the others.

it was of natural causes.

Dr. Morbius,
just what were the symptoms...

249
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:48,147
of all those other deaths,
the unnatural ones?

250
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,851
The symptoms were
striking, Commander.

One by one,
in spite of every safeguard...

literally limb from limb.

By what?

By some devilish thing
that never once showed itself.

00:21:59,868 --> 00:22:01,802
- And the Belerephon?
- Vaporized...

00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,964
as the three remaining survivors
tried to take her off.

257
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,972
And yet, in all these 19 years...

258
00:22:10,045 --> 00:22:14,573
you personally have never again
been bothered by this planetary force?

259
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,819
Only in nightmares
of those times.

260
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:22,118
And yet, always in my mind...

261
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,523
I seem to feel the creature
is lurking somewhere close at hand...

262

sly and irresistible, and only waiting
to be re-invoked for murder.

not to join us for lunch.

But, Father, lunch is over.

I'm sure you never said a word
about not coming in for coffee.

Well, did you or did you?

This is Commander Adams...

Of course, the two end ones
are unbelievable.

Thank you.

280
00:23:28,523 --> 00:23:31,754
Of course, you must make allowances
for my daughter, gentlemen.

281
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:36,127
She's never known any human being
except her father.

00:23:36,198 --> 00:23:38,723
I hope you'll make
allowances too, sir.

283
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,169
We young men have been shut up in
hyperspace for well over a year now...

284
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:45,763
and right from here,
the view looks just like heaven.

Sugar?

286

But you keep helping me.
After all, you're not Robby.

00:23:51,046 --> 00:23:53,913
I wouldn't mind being Robby
in certain ways.

288
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:57,213
That's only in certain ways,
of course.

289
00:23:57,285 --> 00:24:01,483
I can see that was probably very clever,
but I don't seem to understand it.

290
00:24:01,556 --> 00:24:05,083
Well, there's...
There's no rush.

Yes, l...

I suppose one day I shall be obliged
to make the trip to Earth with her...

293

for the sake of her
natural development.

I should say fairly soon too.

295

Your father wasn't too happy at first
about your meeting us, was he?

All three of you are such
very fine exceptions.

- Oh, sure, sure.

That is, I am, anyway.

Old dependable Jerry.

Of course, the doc can be trusted too,

What about the commander?

Well, I hate to tell
you this, Alta, but...

free to discuss...

00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:13,387
any girl or woman who lets him
get her alone, anywhere...

310
00:25:19,534 --> 00:25:21,468
Yes.

311
00:25:21,536 --> 00:25:23,663
Yes, I can see it now.

312
00:25:23,738 --> 00:25:27,640
There, just then when he looked at me,
his eyes almost had fire in them.

313
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:33,046
I'm so glad you don't have
any fire in your eyes, Lieutenant.

314
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:35,309
Well, I'm not that harmless.

315
00:25:35,383 --> 00:25:38,716
- Alta?
- Yes, Father?

316
00:25:40,855 --> 00:25:43,824
These gentlemen have expressed
a very kindly concern...

317
00:25:43,892 --> 00:25:46,656
- over the amount of liberty you have.
- Liberty?

318
00:25:46,728 --> 00:25:50,528
I told them that you have my permission
to visit Earth whenever you choose.

319
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:52,863
Earth? I?

320
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:56,426
Then my little girl
never feels Ionely or confined?

321
00:25:56,504 --> 00:26:00,702
Why, I don't know.
I have you and Robby and all my friends.

322
00:26:00,775 --> 00:26:02,299
Friends?

323
00:26:03,378 --> 00:26:05,471
Uh, yes.

324
00:26:05,547 --> 00:26:08,846
- Perhaps you'd better call them, dear.
- All right.

325
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:10,680
Come, gentlemen.

326
00:26:17,392 --> 00:26:20,657
I felt something
go right through my head.

327
00:26:20,729 --> 00:26:25,291
Alta's whistle is above the pitch of
human hearing. I often feel it myself.

328
00:26:48,323 --> 00:26:50,382
- What's up?
- Look.

329
00:26:53,061 --> 00:26:55,052
[Growling]

330
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,757
No. Watch.

331
00:27:04,506 --> 00:27:06,940
Why, he's as tame as a kitten.

332
00:27:07,008 --> 00:27:11,035
Outside of the range of my daughter's
influence, it's still a deadly beast.

333
00:27:11,112 --> 00:27:14,104
[Growling Softly]

334
00:27:20,588 --> 00:27:22,146
[Communicator Beeps]

335
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,056
- Just a routine checkup from the ship.
- Oh.

336
00:27:25,126 --> 00:27:27,390
- What, Chief?
- Everything okay, Commander?

337
00:27:27,462 --> 00:27:30,454
- No problem.
- Would you mind activating the viewer?

338
00:27:30,532 --> 00:27:31,965
Okay.

339
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:38,330
As you can see, we're under
no restraint whatsoever.

340
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,169
[Quinn Whistles]

341
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,004
Knock that off, Quinn.

342
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:46,275
If I can be of any help to you in your
preparations for the homeward voyage...

343
00:27:46,348 --> 00:27:50,648
Thank you, sir, but unfortunately
circumstances may keep us here a while.

344
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:52,914
- Circumstances?
- You see, my orders...

345
00:27:52,987 --> 00:27:55,478
don't quite seem to cover
the Belerephon fatalities.

346
00:27:55,557 --> 00:27:59,960
I am forced now to contact base
for new instructions.

347
00:28:00,028 --> 00:28:03,054
But, Commander,
suppose these new instructions...

348
00:28:03,131 --> 00:28:06,362
require my return to Earth
for questioning...

349
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:09,062
two years or more
away from my work here?

350
00:28:09,137 --> 00:28:13,597
Tell me, just what is involved
in your making contact with Earth base?

351
00:28:13,675 --> 00:28:16,303
Fundamentally,
it's a question of crude power...

352
00:28:16,378 --> 00:28:19,779
how to short-circuit the continuum
on a five or six parsec level.

353
00:28:19,848 --> 00:28:22,408
Of course, a transmitter like that
isn't standard equipment.

354
00:28:22,484 --> 00:28:24,418
- No.
- To build one...

355
00:28:24,486 --> 00:28:27,922
we'd cannibalize about two-thirds
of the ship's electronic gear...

356
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:30,082
and then unship
the main drive to juice it.

357
00:28:30,158 --> 00:28:34,618
Just to construct a bunker to house
the core would take about ten days.

358
00:28:34,696 --> 00:28:37,859
Disabled here
for ten days and nights?

359
00:28:37,932 --> 00:28:41,299
Tell me, would two-inch
lead shielding do as well?

360
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:44,361
It'd be better if we happened to be
carrying 100 square yards of the stuff.

361
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:46,532
Then I'll have Robby
run it off for you...

362
00:28:46,608 --> 00:28:49,406
and you'll get it
not later than tomorrow noon.

363
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,071
That's very obliging of you, sir.

364
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,047
Obliging?

365
00:28:54,115 --> 00:28:57,107
[Morbius] Look out there, Commander,
the Belerephon party.

366
00:28:57,185 --> 00:29:00,484
Nineteen years ago
I dug those graves with my own hands...

367
00:29:00,555 --> 00:29:04,423
and I have, believe me,
no wish to repeat that experience.

368
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:08,428
[Engine Droning]

369
00:29:18,973 --> 00:29:22,374
We'll see you again soon,
Alta, I hope.

370
00:29:22,444 --> 00:29:26,278
- Thank you very much, Doctor.
- Excellent lunch, Doctor.

371
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:29,316
To tell the truth, I sometimes
still miss the conversation...

372
00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:32,785
of such gentlemen
as yourself, Doctor.

373
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,721
Well, thank you for your
courtesy and concern, sir.

374
00:29:47,235 --> 00:29:50,033
Fasten your seat belts, gentlemen.

375
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,031
Easy with this core. Our M.G. coils
won't take us home without it.

376
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,194
Come on, Cookie, out of the way.
You wanna get run over?

377
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:25,364
Handle it gently.
It has to get us home.

378
00:30:28,676 --> 00:30:32,077
- Is it far enough away from the ship?
- Sure. No interference there.

379
00:30:32,146 --> 00:30:36,378
- What about the magnetic pull?
- Bosun, drop the thing down over there.

380
00:30:36,451 --> 00:30:38,009
Aye, aye, sir.

381
00:30:44,526 --> 00:30:47,893
Where do you wish
the shielding stacked, sir?

382
00:30:47,962 --> 00:30:51,898
You can just put it right over
there by the core, thank you.

383
00:30:51,966 --> 00:30:55,333
Wait a minute.
That's solid lead he's carrying.

384
00:30:55,403 --> 00:30:58,031
Common lead would have
crushed the vehicle, sir.

385
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:02,202
This is my morning's run
of isotope 217.

386
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,711
The whole thing
hardly comes to ten tons.

387
00:31:06,481 --> 00:31:07,914
Hello, Alta.

388
00:31:07,982 --> 00:31:10,542
- Hi.
- Does your father know you're here?

389
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:14,315
He did tell me not to go near the ship,
but this isn't very near.

390
00:31:16,324 --> 00:31:18,258
- Cookie, out of here.
- Aye, aye, sir.

391
00:31:18,326 --> 00:31:20,260
Yes, sir.

392
00:31:30,271 --> 00:31:32,262
[Men Laughing]

393
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,503
Commander, put me down, sir!

394
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:39,111
- Commander.
- What is it, Chief?

395
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,114
If you'd like
to check my assembly...

396
00:31:41,182 --> 00:31:43,548
for the monitor unit
of the Klystron transmitter...

397
00:31:43,618 --> 00:31:46,587
- What, already?
- Yes, sir.

398
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,246
Excellent.

399
00:31:53,094 --> 00:31:56,359
Are... are these condensers
out of my accelerator circuits?

400
00:31:56,431 --> 00:32:00,128
Yes, sir. I borrowed some solenoids
from your gyrostabilizers too.

401
00:32:00,201 --> 00:32:02,135
Here's the big deal, sir.

402
00:32:02,203 --> 00:32:04,671
I'll bet any quantum mechanic
would give his life...

403
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:06,934
for a chance to fool around
with this gadget.

404
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,942
Get this in the ship by dark.

405
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,741
It won't do any good to have some fool
fall on it before we transmit tomorrow.

406
00:32:12,814 --> 00:32:14,748
- Good work, Quinn.
- Thank you, sir.

407
00:32:18,286 --> 00:32:19,719
Psst!

408
00:32:20,622 --> 00:32:22,783
Come here. Over here.

409
00:32:30,898 --> 00:32:32,832
Can I be of service, sir?

410
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,301
Never mind the "sir," but I'm
a stranger in this so-called planet...

411
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,101
and I was just wondering
if you could tell me...

412
00:32:39,173 --> 00:32:42,267
where I could get hold
of some of the real stuff.

413
00:32:42,343 --> 00:32:46,211
- "Real stuff"?
- Just for cooking purposes.

414
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,340
I take a big pride in my duties.

415
00:32:49,417 --> 00:32:52,045
Pardon me, sir. "Stuff"?

416
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,553
Oh.

417
00:32:58,292 --> 00:33:00,089
[Gasps]

418
00:33:00,161 --> 00:33:04,188
Just about one jolt left.
Oh, genuine Ancient Rocket bourbon.

419
00:33:04,265 --> 00:33:06,665
See here? Hey!

420
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:13,037
You low-living contraption!
I oughta take a can opener to you!

421
00:33:13,107 --> 00:33:15,803
Quiet, please.
I am analyzing.

422
00:33:15,877 --> 00:33:17,811
[Robby Burps]

423
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:24,951
Yes, relatively simple alcohol molecules
with traces of fusel oil.

424
00:33:27,355 --> 00:33:30,518
Would 60 gallons be sufficient?

425
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,025
Gallons?

426
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,257
I've been from here to there in
this galaxy, and I want you to know...

427
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:39,697
you're the most understanding soul
I ever met up with.

428
00:33:40,535 --> 00:33:41,968
Ow!

429
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:48,405
It's nothing really personal,
just a kiss.

430
00:33:48,476 --> 00:33:51,775
Hmm. But why should people
want to kiss each other?

431
00:33:51,846 --> 00:33:53,711
It's an old custom.

432
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,306
All the really high civilizations
go in for it.

433
00:33:56,384 --> 00:33:59,353
- But it's so silly.
- But it's good for you, though.

434
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,684
It stimulates the whole system.

435
00:34:01,756 --> 00:34:04,782
As a matter of fact, you can't
be in tip-top health without it.

436
00:34:04,859 --> 00:34:07,589
Really?
I didn't know that.

437
00:34:07,662 --> 00:34:10,290
I'd be only too happy
to show you.

438
00:34:10,364 --> 00:34:12,924
Well, thank you very much,
Lieutenant.

439
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,298
No trouble at all.

440
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:25,437
Is that all there is to it?

441
00:34:26,848 --> 00:34:29,976
Well, you've sort of
got to stick with it.

442
00:34:39,594 --> 00:34:41,926
- Hmm.
- Just once more, do you mind?

443
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,930
Not at all.

444
00:34:50,605 --> 00:34:52,971
There must be something
seriously the matter with me...

445
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,873
because I haven't noticed
the least bit of stimulation.

446
00:34:57,111 --> 00:35:00,512
Honey, let's do this thing right.
Now, here.

447
00:35:15,296 --> 00:35:18,163
Are you giving me the treatment?
Are you?

448
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,434
Lieutenant Farman.

449
00:35:21,502 --> 00:35:23,595
Don't say a word, sir.

450
00:35:23,671 --> 00:35:27,163
I know there are lots of pressing duties
waiting for me back at the ship...

451
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:30,870
and rank doth have
its little privileges, hmm, sir?

452
00:35:30,945 --> 00:35:33,937
And you can depend on it that
those privileges won't be stretched...

453
00:35:34,015 --> 00:35:36,449
into taking your kind of advantages.

454
00:35:36,517 --> 00:35:38,849
- But l...
- Dismissed.

455
00:35:44,692 --> 00:35:48,685
What's the matter with him?
Why did you both act so funny?

456
00:35:48,763 --> 00:35:51,664
Well, what'd you expect?

457
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:54,599
Don't you understand, Alta?

458
00:35:54,669 --> 00:35:58,105
No? Well, look at yourself.

459
00:35:58,172 --> 00:36:03,075
You can't dress like that around men,
especially not a space wolf like Farman.

460
00:36:03,144 --> 00:36:07,444
So for Pete's sake, go home
and put on something that'Il...

461
00:36:07,515 --> 00:36:08,447
Anything.

462
00:36:11,786 --> 00:36:14,516
What's wrong with my clothes?
I designed them myself.

463
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,193
Stop looking at me that way.
I don't think I like it.

464
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,524
Ha-ha.

465
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,327
What do you mean, "ha-ha"?

466
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:27,833
We were just trying to get
some healthy stimulation...

467
00:36:27,902 --> 00:36:30,700
from hugging and kissing,
that's all.

468
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:34,070
Oh, that's all?
It's so easy for you, isn't it?

469
00:36:34,141 --> 00:36:38,475
There's no feelings, no emotions.
You, uh...

470
00:36:38,546 --> 00:36:41,344
Nothing human would
ever enter your mind.

471
00:36:41,415 --> 00:36:45,010
It so happens that I'm in command
of 18 competitively selected...

472
00:36:45,086 --> 00:36:47,350
super-perfect
physical specimens...

473
00:36:47,421 --> 00:36:49,946
with an average age of 24.6...

474
00:36:50,024 --> 00:36:54,688
who have been locked up
in hyperspace for 378 days!

475
00:36:54,762 --> 00:36:58,755
It would have served you right
if I hadn't have... and he...

476
00:37:00,334 --> 00:37:03,497
Get out of here before I have you
run out of the area under guard...

477
00:37:03,571 --> 00:37:06,734
and then I'll put
more guards on the guards!

478
00:37:16,951 --> 00:37:20,148
"And then I'll put
more guards on the guards!"

479
00:37:21,255 --> 00:37:24,452
I don't like him.
I just don't like him.

480
00:37:24,525 --> 00:37:27,790
The way he kept looking at me.
Then he shouted.

481
00:37:27,862 --> 00:37:31,195
- What about?
- I don't know, really.

482
00:37:31,265 --> 00:37:33,233
It was awful.

483
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:36,998
I was only trying to be nice
about kissing the lieutenant.

484
00:37:37,071 --> 00:37:39,005
Oh?

485
00:37:39,073 --> 00:37:42,133
- How did the commander react to that?
- He was furious.

486
00:37:42,209 --> 00:37:45,201
He seemed to think that all that about
biology had something to do with me.

487
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:48,771
Personally, I mean.
I've never been so nervous in my life.

488
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:52,979
I hope I don't see him again
if I live to be 400 million!

489
00:37:53,054 --> 00:37:55,614
Well, I daresay
you won't have to.

490
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,817
The best thing you can do
is to go to bed.

491
00:37:57,892 --> 00:38:00,986
I still have some work
to do in my study.

492
00:38:01,062 --> 00:38:03,326
- Good night, my dear.
- Good night.

493
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:08,768
[Beeping]

494
00:38:12,139 --> 00:38:14,232
[Beeping]

495
00:38:16,844 --> 00:38:18,778
[Beeping]

496
00:38:26,487 --> 00:38:30,184
Where have you been?
I've beamed and beamed.

497
00:38:30,257 --> 00:38:31,519
Sorry, miss.

498
00:38:31,592 --> 00:38:34,322
I was giving myself an oil job.

499
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,455
And what is it you require
this time, Miss Alta?

500
00:38:37,531 --> 00:38:41,558
Robby, I must have a new dress,
right away.

501
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:44,229
- Again?
- But this one must be different.

502
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:47,832
Absolutely nothing must show...
below, above or through.

503
00:38:48,976 --> 00:38:50,841
Radiation-proof?

504
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:53,675
No, just eye-proof will do.

505
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,148
- Thick and heavy?
- Oh, no, Robby.

506
00:38:56,217 --> 00:38:59,550
It must be the loveliest,
softest thing you've ever made for me...

507
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,488
and fit in all the right places,
with lots and lots of star sapphires.

508
00:39:04,558 --> 00:39:08,085
Star sapphires take a week
to crystallize properly.

509
00:39:08,162 --> 00:39:10,824
Would diamonds or emeralds do?

510
00:39:10,898 --> 00:39:13,298
Well, if they're large enough.

511
00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:17,463
Five, ten and fifteen carats,
and on hand.

512
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:20,803
I will run the dress up for you
in time for breakfast.

513
00:39:22,043 --> 00:39:23,908
[Giggles]

514
00:39:23,978 --> 00:39:27,470
- Sleep well, miss.
- Thank you, Robby.

515
00:39:27,548 --> 00:39:30,483
I don't really care now
whether I do or not.

516
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:45,493
Funny to see two moons
in the sky, isn't it?

517
00:39:45,566 --> 00:39:48,034
Funny how quick
a guy gets used to it.

518
00:39:48,102 --> 00:39:49,535
Yeah.

519
00:39:51,105 --> 00:39:53,972
[Breathing Sound]

520
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:56,509
- Joe.
- What?

521
00:39:56,577 --> 00:40:00,343
- Do you hear something?
- Like what?

522
00:40:00,414 --> 00:40:02,882
Like a sort of big breathing.

523
00:40:04,852 --> 00:40:06,376
No.

524
00:40:06,454 --> 00:40:09,582
That's funny. I did.

525
00:40:38,786 --> 00:40:41,380
[Breathing Sound]

526
00:40:53,334 --> 00:40:56,667
Strong and Grey, last night during
your watch this ship was entered...

527
00:40:56,737 --> 00:41:00,036
and valuable government property
was sabotaged.

528
00:41:00,107 --> 00:41:03,770
The two of you claim to have
been at your posts and awake.

529
00:41:03,844 --> 00:41:06,779
Yet this ship was entered,
the heavy-duty hatch was raised...

530
00:41:06,847 --> 00:41:11,045
and latched back, and neither of you
saw or heard anything.

531
00:41:11,118 --> 00:41:13,586
Except you, Grey.
You heard breathing.

532
00:41:14,922 --> 00:41:18,483
And, Youngerford, let me see,
you were asleep in your bunk...

533
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,693
and you think you had a dream.

534
00:41:23,764 --> 00:41:25,755
A dream!

535
00:41:28,002 --> 00:41:30,732
Pending more evidence, you're deprived
of space pay and all privileges.

536
00:41:30,804 --> 00:41:34,638
- Me too, sir?
- No, you'll stand 20 extra watches.

537
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:37,370
I'll have less dreaming
aboard this ship!

538
00:41:38,846 --> 00:41:40,609
Dismissed!

539
00:41:42,683 --> 00:41:44,617
- Skipper.
- Well, Quinn?

540
00:41:44,685 --> 00:41:48,985
Half of this gear we can replace
and the rest we can patch up somehow...

541
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:52,253
except this special
Klystron frequency modulator.

542
00:41:52,326 --> 00:41:55,762
With every facility of the ship,
I think I might be able to rebuild it...

543
00:41:55,829 --> 00:41:58,559
but frankly, the book says no.

544
00:41:58,632 --> 00:42:01,066
It came packed in liquid boron
in a suspended grav...

545
00:42:01,135 --> 00:42:04,229
All right, so it's impossible.
How long will it take?

546
00:42:04,305 --> 00:42:06,899
Well, if I don't
stop for breakfast...

547
00:42:10,878 --> 00:42:13,438
- Get on it, Quinn.
- Thank you, sir.

548
00:42:19,587 --> 00:42:21,077
The tractor's ready, sir.

549
00:42:21,155 --> 00:42:24,818
- Wait. I'll put on a clean uniform.
- You'd better stay as you are.

550
00:42:24,892 --> 00:42:27,452
- I'm leaving you in command here.
- Oh, I see.

551
00:42:27,528 --> 00:42:30,861
Establish a standard perimeter
and set up a class "A" alert by sundown.

552
00:42:30,931 --> 00:42:32,922
Aye, aye, sir.

553
00:42:58,726 --> 00:43:00,660
[Squeaking]

554
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,913
Good morning, gentlemen.

555
00:43:25,986 --> 00:43:28,682
We'd like to see Dr. Morbius.

556
00:43:28,756 --> 00:43:31,088
Morbius is in his study, sir...

557
00:43:31,158 --> 00:43:34,491
never to be disturbed
while that door is closed.

558
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:38,364
All right, we'll wait.

559
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:45,932
Is there any other way
out of there?

560
00:43:46,006 --> 00:43:48,065
This is the only door.

561
00:43:48,142 --> 00:43:52,408
In case you require anything,
gentlemen, use the beamer.

562
00:43:58,786 --> 00:44:01,584
How could he have
slipped past two sentries?

563
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,985
Nothing important, Skipper.

564
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:12,658
Doc, you stay right there where you are
and keep your eye on that door.

565
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:16,601
Okay, Skipper. If Morbius comes out,
we'll call you from right here.

566
00:44:31,785 --> 00:44:33,047
Good morning.

567
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,849
Good morning.

568
00:44:42,796 --> 00:44:46,197
- Come on in.
- Didn't bring my bathing suit.

569
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,791
What's a bathing suit?

570
00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:50,734
Oh, murder.

571
00:44:50,804 --> 00:44:54,240
Never mind.
I'm coming out.

572
00:44:55,909 --> 00:44:57,877
Alta, listen.
You mustn't...

573
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:01,847
You just wait right there.
It'll only take me a second to get dry.

574
00:45:01,915 --> 00:45:04,645
Yes, well, I'Il...

575
00:45:04,718 --> 00:45:08,814
- I'll just turn my back here.
- lf that's the way you feel about it.

576
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,590
Don't worry. You're not gonna
have to look at me anymore.

577
00:45:14,661 --> 00:45:16,253
Hmm?

578
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:17,957
You'll see.

579
00:45:19,233 --> 00:45:22,760
- See what?
- You'll see what.

580
00:45:24,438 --> 00:45:28,465
Now wait a minute, Alta.
If you're planning on...

581
00:45:28,542 --> 00:45:33,411
I sure didn't expect to see you today
after the way you spoke to me yesterday.

582
00:45:35,616 --> 00:45:38,949
I'm very sorry about the way
I spoke to you yesterday.

583
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:41,214
I was sort of bothered.

584
00:45:41,288 --> 00:45:42,880
Hmm.

585
00:45:47,961 --> 00:45:50,725
All right, you can look now.

586
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,300
Nothing shows through, does it?

587
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:03,002
Mm-mm.

588
00:46:04,077 --> 00:46:06,773
I had it made
especially for you.

589
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:11,147
Oh, I thought you weren't
expecting me today.

590
00:46:11,218 --> 00:46:12,879
I wasn't.

591
00:46:14,755 --> 00:46:18,816
I guess there's just something
about me personally you don't like.

592
00:46:18,892 --> 00:46:20,484
Alta...

593
00:46:22,062 --> 00:46:25,054
you always look just beautiful.

594
00:46:26,133 --> 00:46:28,431
Then why don't you kiss me
like everybody else does?

595
00:46:28,502 --> 00:46:30,265
Everybody?

596
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:33,396
Hasn't your father
taught you anything?

597
00:46:33,474 --> 00:46:35,738
Well, he says
I'm terribly ignorant...

598
00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:38,573
but I have had
poetry and mathematics...

599
00:46:38,645 --> 00:46:41,512
Iogic, physics, geology and bi...

600
00:46:41,582 --> 00:46:43,277
Ology?

601
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:46,877
Of course, that's mostly
on the theoretical side.

602
00:46:46,954 --> 00:46:49,479
Well, so far.

603
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:52,753
- Oh?
- What's wrong with theory?

604
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:03,962
This.

605
00:47:27,294 --> 00:47:30,388
[Growling]

606
00:47:30,464 --> 00:47:31,726
Alta.

607
00:47:31,798 --> 00:47:34,699
It's all right.
He's my friend.

608
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:37,532
[Growling]

609

[Zapping]

610
00:47:52,219 --> 00:47:56,019
I'm sorry, Alta.
I had to do that.

611
00:47:56,089 --> 00:47:58,421
He didn't recognize me.

612
00:47:58,492 --> 00:48:00,756
He would've killed me. Why?

613
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:07,496
- You really don't know, do you?
- No, I don't.

614
00:48:22,049 --> 00:48:25,280
- Is he still in there?
- Hasn't come out.

615
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:30,582
Wait a minute, Skipper.
After all, it is his house.

616
00:48:32,426 --> 00:48:34,360
What's the matter?

617
00:48:35,529 --> 00:48:38,362
Doc, something new
has been added.

618
00:48:40,601 --> 00:48:42,034
Ooh.

619
00:48:43,103 --> 00:48:45,731
That's gonna
complicate things a bit.

620
00:48:45,806 --> 00:48:47,398
Yeah.

621
00:49:02,956 --> 00:49:04,947
Not even a window.

622
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:08,517
The robot lied.
Morbius hasn't been in here.

623
00:49:08,595 --> 00:49:10,790
Doc, he's up to something.

624
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:13,128
Look at this, Skipper.

625
00:49:15,168 --> 00:49:18,399
- Hieroglyphics?
- Maybe.

626
00:49:18,472 --> 00:49:21,669
But it doesn't look like
Egyptian or cuneiform...

627
00:49:21,742 --> 00:49:23,334
or Chinese.

628
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,114
You'll find the household silver
in the dining room...

629
00:49:29,182 --> 00:49:32,242
and my daughter's jewelry
on her dressing table.

630
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,753
Dr. Morbius...

631
00:49:36,456 --> 00:49:40,119
last night our Klystron monitor
was sabotaged.

632
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:43,795
And you suspect me?

633
00:49:43,864 --> 00:49:46,890
Then the time has come
for clarification.

634
00:49:46,967 --> 00:49:48,559
Sit down.

635
00:49:58,645 --> 00:50:01,136
In times long past...

636
00:50:01,214 --> 00:50:05,241
this planet was the home of
a mighty and noble race of beings...

637
00:50:05,318 --> 00:50:07,878
which called themselves the Krell.

638
00:50:07,954 --> 00:50:10,787
Ethically,
as well as technologically...

639
00:50:10,857 --> 00:50:14,088
they were a million years
ahead of humankind...

640
00:50:14,161 --> 00:50:16,891
for in unlocking
the mysteries of nature...

641
00:50:16,963 --> 00:50:19,796
they had conquered
even their baser selves...

642
00:50:19,866 --> 00:50:23,097
and when, in the course of eons,
they had abolished sickness...

643
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:26,003
and insanity and crime
and all injustice...

644
00:50:26,073 --> 00:50:28,337
they turned,
still with high benevolence...

645
00:50:28,408 --> 00:50:31,036
outward toward space.

646
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:34,842
Long before the dawn of man's history,
they had walked our Earth...

647
00:50:34,915 --> 00:50:37,247
and brought back
many biological specimens.

648
00:50:37,317 --> 00:50:41,219
I see. That explains
the tiger and the deer.

649
00:50:42,589 --> 00:50:44,819
The heights they had reached...

650
00:50:44,891 --> 00:50:49,487
but then, seemingly on the threshold
of some supreme accomplishment...

651
00:50:49,563 --> 00:50:52,862
which was to have crowned
their entire history...

652
00:50:52,933 --> 00:50:56,960
this all but divine race
perished in a single night.

653
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:02,404
In the 2,000 centuries
since that unexplained catastrophe...

654
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,569
even their
cloud-piercing towers...

655
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:07,374
of glass and porcelain
and adamantine steel...

656
00:51:07,447 --> 00:51:10,382
have crumbled back into
the soil of Altair-4...

657
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:14,580
and nothing, absolutely nothing
remains above ground.

658
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:17,214
What were they like?

659
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:20,521
No record of their
physical nature has survived...

660
00:51:20,594 --> 00:51:25,429
except, perhaps, in the form
of this characteristic arch.

661
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,263
I suggest you consider it
in comparison to one of our...

662
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:31,236
functionally designed human doorways.

663
00:51:38,645 --> 00:51:40,636
[Electronic Humming]

664
00:51:40,714 --> 00:51:44,241
[Strange Electronic Tonalities]

665
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:51,418
That recording was made by Krell
musicians a half a million years ago.

666
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:57,629
If you will follow me, I will show you
some of their other remaining artifacts.

667
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,872
Krell metal.
Try your blaster there, Commander.

668
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:34,362
This spot should be molten.

669
00:52:34,434 --> 00:52:38,530
It's not even warm,
and no trace of radioactivity.

670
00:52:38,605 --> 00:52:41,540
The molecules are many times
more densely interlocked...

671
00:52:41,608 --> 00:52:43,599
than in earthly steel...

672
00:52:43,677 --> 00:52:45,804
yet it drinks up energy
like a sponge.

673
00:53:04,898 --> 00:53:07,867
This is just one
of their laboratories.

674
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:10,767
You will notice that much
of the equipment is familiar...

675
00:53:10,837 --> 00:53:13,397
though designed
for nonhuman technicians.

676
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:22,609
What's this?

677
00:53:25,252 --> 00:53:27,220
On this screen
may be projected...

678
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,653
the total scientific knowledge
of the Krell...

679
00:53:29,723 --> 00:53:33,056
from its primitive beginning
to the day of its annihilation...

680
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:36,755
a sheer bulk surpassing
many million earthly libraries.

681
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:39,822
- You're able to read this?
- A little. It's my profession.

682
00:53:41,034 --> 00:53:43,525
Twenty years ago,
I began here with...

683
00:53:43,603 --> 00:53:45,628
this page
of geometrical theorems.

684
00:53:45,705 --> 00:53:49,801
Eventually I was able to deduce
most of their huge, logical alphabet.

685
00:53:49,876 --> 00:53:51,275
I began to learn.

686
00:53:51,344 --> 00:53:54,040
The first practical result
was my robot...

687
00:53:54,114 --> 00:53:57,049
which you gentlemen
appear to find so remarkable.

688
00:53:57,117 --> 00:53:59,085
Child's play.

689
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:01,382
I've come here every day now
for two decades...

690
00:54:01,454 --> 00:54:05,686
painfully picking up a few of the least
difficult fragments of their knowledge.

691
00:54:05,759 --> 00:54:09,286
A thing like this,
it's too big to evaluate.

692
00:54:09,362 --> 00:54:11,330
- Think what a discovery of this kind...
- Dr. Morbius...

693
00:54:11,398 --> 00:54:13,628
what is this device over here?

694
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,760
I call it
their "plastic educator."

695
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:21,432
As far as I can make out, they used it
to condition and test their young...

696
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:24,500
in much the same way
as we once employed finger-painting...

697
00:54:24,611 --> 00:54:26,169
among our kindergarten children.

698
00:54:26,246 --> 00:54:29,044
I often play with it myself
for relaxation...

699
00:54:29,115 --> 00:54:31,811
although working here,
I sometimes wish I'd been blessed...

700
00:54:31,885 --> 00:54:33,853
with multiple arms and legs.

701
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,289
Now, you can see
that this headset...

702
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:40,758
was designed for something
much bulkier than my human cranium.

703
00:54:46,066 --> 00:54:48,728
Now, over here you see...

704
00:54:48,802 --> 00:54:51,396
the electromagnetic waves
of my brain...

705
00:54:51,471 --> 00:54:54,099
sending that indicator up
about halfway.

706
00:54:55,241 --> 00:54:58,677
I gather that
one of their own young...

707
00:54:58,745 --> 00:55:00,838
comparable to
a seven-year-old child...

708
00:55:00,914 --> 00:55:03,781
was normally expected to send that
all the way to the top...

709
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:07,479
which by Krell standards
classifies me as a low-grade moron.

710
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,751
Yet I have
an officially recorded IQ of 183.

711
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:14,458
Now then, for the primary function.

712
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:19,225
Actually, to operate...

713
00:55:19,299 --> 00:55:23,963
Well, I'll choose a familiar subject
to start with to save time.

714
00:55:31,378 --> 00:55:32,845
There now, gentlemen.

715
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:39,509
What's that?

716
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,019
What's happening there?

717
00:55:46,726 --> 00:55:48,159
A statue.

718
00:55:53,666 --> 00:55:54,997
That's Altaira.

719
00:55:55,068 --> 00:55:57,798
Simply a three-dimensional image,
Commander.

720
00:55:57,871 --> 00:55:59,304
But it's alive!

721
00:55:59,372 --> 00:56:03,968
Because my daughter is alive in my brain
from microsecond to microsecond...

722
00:56:04,044 --> 00:56:05,568
while I manipulate.

723
00:56:07,347 --> 00:56:08,780
There.

724
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:11,583
Something of a strain.

725
00:56:12,819 --> 00:56:15,845
Aladdin's lamp
in a physics laboratory.

726
00:56:15,922 --> 00:56:18,857
Would you gentlemen care to take
the Krell test of your intelligence?

727
00:56:18,925 --> 00:56:21,758
- Yes, very much.
- You may be disappointed, Commander.

728
00:56:21,828 --> 00:56:24,592
Suppose we start
with the good doctor.

729
00:56:24,664 --> 00:56:27,462
- What do I do?
- Just sit down there, and I'Il...

730
00:56:28,835 --> 00:56:30,530
Move forward.

731
00:56:30,603 --> 00:56:32,366
There now.

732
00:56:32,439 --> 00:56:35,636
Now, Doctor,
you can read it here.

733
00:56:35,708 --> 00:56:37,232
There's something wrong here.

734
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:40,575
I have an IQ of 161...

735
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:44,276
yet I don't register
a third what you did.

736
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:46,011
Now the commander.

737
00:57:00,266 --> 00:57:03,531
It's all right, sir. A commanding
officer doesn't need brains.

738
00:57:03,603 --> 00:57:05,764
Just a good loud voice, huh?

739
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,773
Do I pull this switch
to make an image?

740
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,468
Stop! You'd never survive.

741
00:57:09,542 --> 00:57:14,536
Our Belerephon skipper tried it,
and it was instantly fatal to him.

742
00:57:14,614 --> 00:57:18,880
Oh, I see.
So you're immune to this too?

743
00:57:18,952 --> 00:57:21,716
In my first attempt
at creating an image here...

744
00:57:21,788 --> 00:57:25,224
my brain pattern there
was scarcely any larger than yours.

745
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:27,657
Afterwards, I lay unconscious
for a day and a night.

746
00:57:28,761 --> 00:57:31,229
Yet you came back
for a second go at it.

747
00:57:32,398 --> 00:57:34,662
It was a question
of science, Doctor...

748
00:57:34,734 --> 00:57:37,965
but you can imagine my joy
when I discovered that the shock...

749
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:42,974
had permanently doubled
my intellectual capacity.

750
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:46,978
Otherwise, my researches here
would have come to nothing...

751
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,980
poor as they have been.

752
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:54,781
Recently I have turned up
some rather puzzling indications...

753
00:57:54,854 --> 00:57:58,119
that in those final days
before their annihilation...

754
00:57:58,191 --> 00:58:01,126
the Krell had been applying
their entire racial energies...

755
00:58:01,194 --> 00:58:02,786
to a new project...

756
00:58:02,862 --> 00:58:05,126
one which they actually
seemed to hope...

757
00:58:05,198 --> 00:58:08,190
might somehow free them
once and for all...

758
00:58:08,268 --> 00:58:12,204
from any dependence
on physical instrumentalities.

759
00:58:12,272 --> 00:58:14,206
A civilization
without instrumentalities?

760
00:58:14,274 --> 00:58:15,468
Incredible.

761
00:58:15,542 --> 00:58:18,943
Dr. Morbius,
everything here is new.

762
00:58:19,012 --> 00:58:21,947
Not a sign of age or wear
on any of it.

763
00:58:22,015 --> 00:58:26,748
Young man, these devices,
self-serviced, self-maintained...

764
00:58:26,819 --> 00:58:31,017
have stood exactly as you see them
for 2,000 centuries.

765
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,921
2,000 centuries?

766
00:58:32,992 --> 00:58:35,927
And during all this time,
what was their power source?

767
00:58:35,995 --> 00:58:37,929
That's a good question.

768
00:58:37,997 --> 00:58:40,989
May I draw your attention
to these gauges...

769
00:58:41,067 --> 00:58:43,035
all around here, gentlemen?

770
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:46,104
Their calibrations
appear to indicate...

771
00:58:46,172 --> 00:58:48,299
that they are set
in decimal series...

772
00:58:48,374 --> 00:58:51,309
each division recording
exactly ten times as many amperes...

773
00:58:51,377 --> 00:58:53,311

777
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,521
But there is no direct wiring
that I can discover.

778
00:59:05,692 --> 00:59:08,160
However, when I
activate this machine...

779
00:59:08,228 --> 00:59:10,321
it registers infinitesimally,
you see...

down there in the lower
left-hand corner.

781

And then...

782
00:59:15,368 --> 00:59:18,769
when I activate
the educator here...

783
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:23,265
it registers a little more.

784
00:59:23,343 --> 00:59:26,437
But this much is negligible.

785
00:59:26,512 --> 00:59:30,209
The total potential here must be
nothing less than astronomical.

786

Nothing less.

Dr. Morbius, a scientific find

and I hope dispassionately,
considering this very problem...

870
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:36,992

No. This thing runs counter to

Yet this claw could only belong

I'm obliged to remind you that I gave
him permission to go out last night.

just for cordial interplanetary
relations, you understand.

Even while the chief was being killed?

Certainly, sir.

I hope you don't think I got

All right. Dismissed.

01:11:01,974 --> 01:11:04,670
I guess that kind of
washes the robot up.

931
01:11:04,743 --> 01:11:06,677
Where does that leave us
for suspects?

932
01:11:06,745 --> 01:11:09,111
Maybe it leaves us
with the same one.

933
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:11,615
Maybe we should drop over
to that Krell laboratory...

934
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:14,152
and get our IQs boosted
a couple of hundred percent.

935
01:11:14,219 --> 01:11:16,153
Sir, burial detail is ready.

936
01:11:19,325 --> 01:11:22,351
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

937
01:11:26,498 --> 01:11:28,489
- Dismissed.
- Company, dismissed.

938
01:11:38,777 --> 01:11:39,903
Fine technician.

939
01:11:41,814 --> 01:11:43,805
Good shipmate.

940
01:11:43,882 --> 01:11:46,180
That's a good epitaph
for any man.

941
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:55,159
Good day, Dr. Morbius.

942
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:58,287
I daresay neither of us
slept any last night.

943
01:11:58,364 --> 01:12:00,525
That's a pretty close guess.

944
01:12:00,599 --> 01:12:03,534
I warned you while your ship
was still in space.

945
01:12:03,602 --> 01:12:06,435
I begged you not to land
on this planet.

946
01:12:06,505 --> 01:12:10,236
Believe me, Commander,
that is only a foretaste.

947
01:12:10,309 --> 01:12:12,709
The Belerephon pattern
is being woven again.

948
01:12:14,146 --> 01:12:18,310
Remain here and the next attack
on your party...

949
01:12:18,384 --> 01:12:22,844
will be more deadly and general.

950
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:24,889
How do you know that?

951
01:12:26,959 --> 01:12:29,154
Know? l...

952
01:12:29,228 --> 01:12:31,753
I seem to visualize it.

953
01:12:34,633 --> 01:12:36,692
If you wish, call it...

954
01:12:38,203 --> 01:12:40,137
a premonition.

955
01:12:55,054 --> 01:12:57,022
What do you make of that, Skipper?

956
01:12:57,089 --> 01:12:59,216
I'd say it sounded
like an ultimatum.

957
01:13:00,325 --> 01:13:01,758
- Bosun.
- Aye, sir.

958
01:13:06,265 --> 01:13:08,995
Bosun. I want a clear field
of fire in all directions.

959
01:13:09,068 --> 01:13:11,002
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Randall?

960
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:13,004
How soon will radar
be operational?

961
01:13:13,072 --> 01:13:15,666
- Operating right now, sir.
- Good. Keep on it yourself.

962
01:13:15,741 --> 01:13:18,437
- Aye, aye, sir.
- The M.A. alert is completed?

963
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:21,240
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Fine.

964
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:22,905
Activate main batteries.

965
01:13:29,254 --> 01:13:32,189
- Alarm for test.

969
01:13:58,584 --> 01:14:00,916
Lieutenant, you got
your trouble squad in hand?

970
01:14:00,986 --> 01:14:03,420
Yes, sir, but they're
a little trigger-happy.

971
01:14:03,489 --> 01:14:05,957
They're sort of edgy
to see whatever's out there.

972
01:14:07,726 --> 01:14:08,988
Oh, Jerry.

973
01:14:12,831 --> 01:14:15,766
This may be a big deal coming up.

974
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:19,462
I'm sorry if I've leaned on you...

975
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:23,497
Stop knocking yourself out, Skipper.
She picked the right man.

[Communicator Beeps]

977
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:29,540
- What is it, Randall?
- Radar just picked up something.

978
01:14:29,615 --> 01:14:31,549
- Where away?
- At the head of the arroyo.

979
01:14:31,617 --> 01:14:33,551
- Moving?
- This way. Slowly.

Batteries, fire!

982
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:56,474
Batteries, hold fire.

983
01:14:57,543 --> 01:14:59,534
Do you see anything out there?

984
01:15:00,646 --> 01:15:02,079
Nothing.

985
01:15:03,882 --> 01:15:06,350
Batteries, fire!

986
01:15:10,989 --> 01:15:12,923
Batteries, cease fire.

987
01:15:13,992 --> 01:15:16,222
- Randall.
- Dead on target, sir.

988
01:15:16,295 --> 01:15:17,785
Good.

989
01:15:17,863 --> 01:15:20,127
- Give me audio-com.
- Aye, aye, sir.

990
01:15:20,199 --> 01:15:21,791
Attention!

991
01:15:21,867 --> 01:15:24,927
This may have been a ruse to divert us
from some other part of the perimeter.

992
01:15:25,003 --> 01:15:27,335
Continue watching
on your own immediate fronts.

It just stopped
at the foot of the pass.

996
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:40,551
Are you sure you've got
a real blip there?

997
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:43,713
Big as a house, and we were
on target with both bursts.

998
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:45,552
It's coming on again!

999
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:47,649
- Straight across?
- It shows here.

1000
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:49,993
It's still coming!

What is it?
What's the matter?

1020
01:18:07,532 --> 01:18:09,864
I just had a terrible dream!

1021
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:12,335
There was blood and fire
and thunder...

1022
01:18:12,404 --> 01:18:15,965
and something awful was moving
in the middle of it.

1023
01:18:16,041 --> 01:18:18,475
I could hear it roar and bellow.

1024
01:18:18,543 --> 01:18:20,704
Now, now. You know
a dream can't hurt you.

1025
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:23,509
Not me. Not us.

1026
01:18:23,582 --> 01:18:25,743
The thing I saw was trying
to break in the camp.

1027
01:18:25,817 --> 01:18:27,910
It was gonna kill...

You'll take care of him for me,
won't you? You'll protect him.

My darling, I'm completely helpless
as long as he remains here so willfully.

Come now.

- Bosun.
- Yes, sir?

1032
01:18:53,345 --> 01:18:55,336
Get those graves dug.
Keep the men busy.

Give me audio-com.

Well, men, whatever it was,
our main battery stopped it.

1036
01:19:07,559 --> 01:19:09,083
You believe that?

1037
01:19:10,796 --> 01:19:13,287
No, it just went away
for some reason. It'll be back.

1038
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:18,235
Doc, an invisible being...

1039
01:19:18,303 --> 01:19:20,703
that cannot be disintegrated
by atomic fission.

1040
01:19:22,207 --> 01:19:25,643
No, Skipper. That is
a scientific impossibility.

1041

Hypnotic illusions
don't tear people apart.

1042

That's true enough...

1043
01:19:30,315 --> 01:19:34,251
but any organism dense enough to survive
three billion electron volts...

1044
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:38,517
would have to be made
of solid nuclear material.

1045
01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:40,649
It would sink of its own weight
to the center of this planet.

1046
01:19:40,725 --> 01:19:43,626
You saw it yourself standing there
in those neutron beams.

01:19:43,695 --> 01:19:45,162
There's your answer.

1048
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:47,494
It must have been renewing
its molecular structure...

1049
01:19:47,566 --> 01:19:49,500
from one microsecond
to the next.

"Evacuate all civilians
from disaster areas."

1054
01:20:04,349 --> 01:20:06,909
You left out
two very important words.

1055
01:20:06,985 --> 01:20:08,509
"Where feasible."

1056
01:20:08,587 --> 01:20:11,681
If you remember
the Belerephon expedition...

1057
01:20:11,756 --> 01:20:13,690
their ship was vaporized
trying to lift off.

1058
01:20:13,758 --> 01:20:16,989
Which makes it a gilt-edged priority
that one of us...

1059
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:19,724
gets into that Krell lab
and takes that brain boost.

1060
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:23,724
- Bosun.
- Aye, sir?

1061
01:20:26,004 --> 01:20:28,268
I'm leaving you in command.
Get the ship operational.

1062
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:30,934
Do your best to wait it out
for me and the doctor...

1063
01:20:31,009 --> 01:20:34,001
but the second that fence starts
to short again, lift off...

1064
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:37,515
and report back to Earth base
on conditions in this sector.

1065
01:20:37,582 --> 01:20:39,015
Right, Skipper.

1066
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:55,029
All right. Get everything
aboard ship. We're pullin' out!

1067
01:21:18,456 --> 01:21:19,889
No lights showing.

1068
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:22,221
Yeah.

1069
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:27,860
Look, Doc, in case
we make it into that lab...

1070
01:21:27,933 --> 01:21:29,924
I'll take the first go
at the IQ booster.

1071
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:33,069
You hear me?

1072
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:34,571
I hear you.

1073
01:21:50,855 --> 01:21:54,222
I am monitored to admit no one
at this hour.

1074
01:21:57,495 --> 01:21:58,928
That sounded final.

1075
01:22:01,666 --> 01:22:03,600
Maybe if we reasoned with him.

1076
01:22:10,075 --> 01:22:13,374
My beams are focused
on your blasters, gentlemen.

1077
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:26,791
Hasn't he got a built-in rule
against wringing our necks for us?

1078

[Robby]
That is true, sir.

1079
01:22:29,861 --> 01:22:32,796

to admit no one.

Three more men dead,
including Jerry Farman.

01:23:10,001 --> 01:23:11,935
I don't know.
It was...

1089
01:23:12,003 --> 01:23:15,769
just some kind of big outline
in the disintegrator beams.

1090
01:23:16,875 --> 01:23:18,536
And you can't explain it?

1091
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:19,872
No.

1092
01:23:21,579 --> 01:23:24,173
Well, anyway, we fought it,
and we lost.

1093
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:27,480
- I figure it'll be back.
- You must leave, now.

1094
01:23:27,552 --> 01:23:29,247
I'm not going without you.

1095
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:32,483
But I can't possibly leave him alone.
I just can't.

1096
01:23:32,557 --> 01:23:34,752
- Then we'll take him.
- By force?

1097
01:23:34,826 --> 01:23:36,760
I can't agree to that either.

1098
01:23:36,828 --> 01:23:39,763
Can't you? You don't realize
what's loose on this planet!

1099
01:23:39,831 --> 01:23:41,799
But I'm immune,
like both my parents.

1100
01:23:41,866 --> 01:23:44,096
That's what he says.
Nothing could be immune to that thing...

1101
01:23:44,169 --> 01:23:46,535
Oh, darling, please go.

1102
01:23:52,777 --> 01:23:55,075
Oh, please.
If you love me, go.

1103
01:23:55,146 --> 01:23:59,549
Alta. Doc, will you talk
some sense to this girl?

1104
01:23:59,617 --> 01:24:02,017
I'm in over my head. Doc?

1105
01:24:03,221 --> 01:24:04,483
Doc?

1106
01:24:06,558 --> 01:24:07,991
Doc?

1107
01:24:09,094 --> 01:24:11,028
On the sofa, Robby.

1108
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:24,408
So you took the brain boost, huh?

1109
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:27,445
[Panting]
You oughta see my new mind.

1110
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:31,943
Up there in lights.
Bigger than his now.

1111
01:24:33,685 --> 01:24:35,710
Easy, Doc.

1112
01:24:35,787 --> 01:24:39,052
Morbius was too close
to the problem.

1113
01:24:40,391 --> 01:24:42,518
The Krell had completed their project.

1114
01:24:43,661 --> 01:24:45,458
That big machine.

1115
01:24:45,530 --> 01:24:47,020
No instrumentalities.

1116
01:24:48,166 --> 01:24:49,656
True creation.

1117
01:24:50,802 --> 01:24:52,429
Doc, let's have it.

1118
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:55,029
- But the Krell forgot one thing.
- Yes, what?

1119
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:57,941
Monsters, John.

1120
01:24:59,077 --> 01:25:01,272
Monsters from the Id.

1121
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:03,439
The Id? What's that?

1122
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:04,948
Talk, Doc.

1123
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:10,783
Doc?

1124
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:15,917
Oh, Doc.

1125
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:19,458
Doc.

1126
01:25:33,411 --> 01:25:34,844
How romantic!

1127
01:25:39,717 --> 01:25:42,311
The fool!
The meddling idiot!

1128
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:45,515
As though his ape's brain
could contain the secrets of the Krell.

1129
01:25:47,325 --> 01:25:49,793
Father, he's dead.

1130
01:25:49,861 --> 01:25:52,557
He was warned,
and now he's paid.

1131
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:56,259
Let him be buried with the other victims
of human greed and folly.

1132
01:26:02,073 --> 01:26:05,873
Morbius, you wanted me
to make a choice.

1133
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:09,076
Now you've chosen for me.

1134
01:26:09,147 --> 01:26:11,877
- Alta!
- I'm ready to go with you, darling.

1135
01:26:11,950 --> 01:26:13,884
Altaira! No!

1136
01:26:13,952 --> 01:26:16,011
[Robby] I will place him
in the tractor, sir.

1137
01:26:16,087 --> 01:26:17,520
Thank you.

1138
01:26:18,756 --> 01:26:20,747
She mustn't do this.
She must be prevented.

1139
01:26:20,825 --> 01:26:22,588
Morbius, what is the Id?

1140
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:26,619
My daughter is planning a very foolish
action, and she'll be terribly punished.

1141
01:26:26,698 --> 01:26:29,030
- What is the Id?
- Id! Id! Id!

1142
01:26:32,070 --> 01:26:34,038
It's an obsolete term...

1143
01:26:35,139 --> 01:26:37,107
I'm afraid,
once used to describe...

1144
01:26:37,175 --> 01:26:41,441
the elementary basis
of the subconscious mind.

1145
01:26:44,382 --> 01:26:46,316
- Monsters from the Id.
- Huh?

1146
01:26:48,386 --> 01:26:50,616
Monsters from the subconscious.

1147
01:26:53,424 --> 01:26:55,619
Of course.
That's what Doc meant.

1148
01:26:56,995 --> 01:26:58,860
Morbius...

1149
01:26:58,930 --> 01:27:01,626
the big machine... 8,000 cubic miles
of Klystron relays...

1150
01:27:01,699 --> 01:27:04,395
enough power for a whole population
of creative geniuses...

1151
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:06,733
operated by remote control.

1152
01:27:06,804 --> 01:27:10,001
Morbius, operated by
the electromagnetic impulses...

1153
01:27:10,074 --> 01:27:12,372
of individual Krell brains.

1154
01:27:12,443 --> 01:27:13,671
To what purpose?

1155
01:27:13,745 --> 01:27:16,578
In return, that machine would
instantaneously project solid matter...

1156
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:20,084
to any point on the planet, in any shape
or color they might imagine...

1157
01:27:20,151 --> 01:27:22,085
for any purpose, Morbius!

1158
01:27:23,054 --> 01:27:24,646
Creation by mere thought.

1159
01:27:24,722 --> 01:27:27,657
Why haven't I seen this all along?

1160
01:27:29,327 --> 01:27:32,353
Like you, the Krell forgot
one deadly danger...

1161
01:27:32,430 --> 01:27:36,457
their own subconscious hate
and lust for destruction.

1162
01:27:36,534 --> 01:27:39,469
The beast.
The mindless primitive.

1163
01:27:41,105 --> 01:27:44,165
Even the Krell must have
evolved from that beginning.

1164
01:27:45,243 --> 01:27:48,235
And so those mindless beasts
of the subconscious...

1165
01:27:48,313 --> 01:27:50,873
had access to a machine
that could never be shut down.

1166
01:27:50,949 --> 01:27:54,043
The secret devil
of every soul on the planet...

1167
01:27:54,118 --> 01:27:56,609
all set free at once
to loot and maim...

1168
01:27:57,889 --> 01:27:59,880
and take revenge and kill!

1169
01:28:01,826 --> 01:28:03,851
My poor Krell!

1170
01:28:08,066 --> 01:28:11,433
After a million years
of shining sanity...

1171
01:28:13,771 --> 01:28:17,172
they could hardly have understood
what power was destroying them.

1172
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:23,413
Yes, young man.

1173
01:28:24,816 --> 01:28:28,980
All very convincing
but for one obvious fallacy.

1174
01:28:30,588 --> 01:28:34,888
The last Krell died
2,000 centuries ago...

1175
01:28:34,959 --> 01:28:37,154
but today, as we all know...

1176
01:28:37,228 --> 01:28:40,163
there is still at large
on this planet a living monster.

1177
01:28:41,833 --> 01:28:45,633
Your mind refuses
to face a conclusion.

1178
01:28:45,703 --> 01:28:46,771
What do you mean?

1179
01:28:46,771 --> 01:28:47,169
What do you mean?

1180
01:28:48,306 --> 01:28:49,773
[Robby]
Morbius.

1181
01:28:51,976 --> 01:28:53,443
- Morbius!
- What?

1182
01:28:53,511 --> 01:28:56,378
Something is approaching
from the southwest.

1183
01:28:56,447 --> 01:28:58,415
It is now quite close.

01:29:31,382 --> 01:29:34,112
I feel sorry for you,

1190
01:29:34,185 --> 01:29:36,483
Feel sorry for your
daughter, Morbius.

1191
01:29:39,557 --> 01:29:41,115
It's listening.

01:29:47,298 --> 01:29:50,324
- Alta, go into my study.
- You still refuse to face the truth.

1194
01:29:50,401 --> 01:29:53,461
- What truth?
- Morbius, that thing out there.

1195
01:29:53,538 --> 01:29:55,472
- It's you.
- You're insane!

1196
01:29:55,540 --> 01:29:58,304
You have led it here where Alta
must see you torn to pieces!

1197
01:29:58,376 --> 01:30:01,004
You think she's immune?
She's joined herself to me!

1198
01:30:01,079 --> 01:30:03,445
- Yes, and whatever comes, forever.
- Say it's a lie.

1199
01:30:03,514 --> 01:30:06,278
Let it hear you!
Tell it you don't love this man!

1200
01:30:06,350 --> 01:30:08,648
Not even if I could.

1201
01:30:12,924 --> 01:30:15,859
Stop it, Robby!
Don't let it in! Kill it!

We're safe.

1206
01:31:03,374 --> 01:31:05,968
Why did you jumble
that combination?

1207
01:31:06,043 --> 01:31:09,274
Whatever you know in here,
your twin self in the tunnel knows too.

1208
01:31:09,347 --> 01:31:11,315
I'm not a monster, you...

1209
01:31:12,617 --> 01:31:15,711
We're all part monsters
in our subconscious!

1210
01:31:15,786 --> 01:31:18,550
- So we have laws and religion.
- Let me go!

1211
01:31:18,623 --> 01:31:21,786
You've got to listen.
We don't have much time.

1212
01:31:23,394 --> 01:31:25,328
Here.

1213
01:31:25,396 --> 01:31:27,387
Here's where your mind
was artificially enlarged.

1214
01:31:27,465 --> 01:31:30,628
Consciously it still lacked the power
to operate the great machine...

1215
01:31:30,701 --> 01:31:33,101
but your subconscious
had been made strong enough!

1216
01:31:33,171 --> 01:31:35,901
- I won't hear you!
- You've got to listen!

1217
01:31:35,973 --> 01:31:39,306
Twenty years ago, when your comrades
voted to return to Earth...

1218
01:31:39,377 --> 01:31:42,505
you sent your secret Id out
to murder them!

1219
01:31:47,118 --> 01:31:50,781
Not quite realizing it, of course,
except maybe in your dreams.

1220
01:31:52,089 --> 01:31:54,580
What man can remember
his own dreams?

1221
01:31:54,659 --> 01:31:58,789
At least when we approached from space,
you remembered enough to warn us off.

1222
01:31:58,863 --> 01:32:03,129
But when you thought we were a threat
to your little egomaniac empire...

1223
01:32:03,201 --> 01:32:06,830
your subconscious
sent its Id monster out again!

1224
01:32:06,904 --> 01:32:09,839
More deaths, Morbius.
More murder!

1225
01:32:09,907 --> 01:32:13,468
And now this too?
Harm my own daughter?

1226
01:32:13,544 --> 01:32:16,035
But now she's defying you, Morbius...

1227
01:32:16,113 --> 01:32:18,638
and even in you, the loving father,
there still exists...

1228
01:32:18,716 --> 01:32:20,479
the mindless primitive...

1229
01:32:20,551 --> 01:32:24,317
more enraged and more inflamed
with each new frustration.

1230
01:32:24,388 --> 01:32:26,754
So now you're whistling up
your monster again...

1231
01:32:26,824 --> 01:32:29,258
to punish her for her disloyalty
and disobedience!

1232
01:32:31,395 --> 01:32:34,364
And if you don't do something
about it soon...

1233
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:37,060

to supply your monster...

with whatever amount of power
it requires to reach us.

Tell me you don't!

1243
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:39,963
Then it must be true.

1244
01:33:40,865 --> 01:33:42,924
Yes, I must be guilty!

1245
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,161
Then help us, darling!

1246
01:33:45,236 --> 01:33:48,763
I've known you great and noble
like the Krell.

1247
01:34:05,656 --> 01:34:08,420
Guilty! Guilty!

1248
01:34:08,492 --> 01:34:12,861
My evil self is at that door,
and I have no power to stop it!

1249
01:34:19,170 --> 01:34:24,301
[Machine Alarm Blaring]

1250
01:34:44,462 --> 01:34:47,192
Stop! No further!
I deny you! I give you up!

1251
01:34:47,264 --> 01:34:49,323
[Alarm Blaring]

1252
01:34:59,377 --> 01:35:05,316
[Alarm Subsides, Stops]

1253
01:35:08,185 --> 01:35:11,120
Father. Oh, Father.

1254
01:35:14,892 --> 01:35:16,223
Son...

1255
01:35:17,962 --> 01:35:19,395
turn that disc.

1256
01:35:26,570 --> 01:35:28,629
The switch. Throw it.

1257
01:35:38,449 --> 01:35:40,041
In 24 hours...

1258
01:35:41,452 --> 01:35:46,480
you must be 100 million miles
out in space.

1259
01:35:49,326 --> 01:35:51,726
The Krell furnaces...

1260
01:35:51,796 --> 01:35:53,821
Chain reaction...

1261
01:35:53,898 --> 01:35:56,492
They cannot be reversed.

1262
01:35:57,701 --> 01:35:58,963
Alta!

1263
01:36:01,705 --> 01:36:03,536
Oh, no!

1264
01:36:12,683 --> 01:36:16,175
98.6 million.
We're clear now.

1265
01:36:19,356 --> 01:36:20,789
Quite an astrogator.

1266
01:36:22,393 --> 01:36:25,055
A genuine privilege, Commander.

1267
01:36:25,129 --> 01:36:27,290
Activate main view-plate.

1268
01:36:27,364 --> 01:36:28,831
Aye, aye, Skipper.

1269
01:36:31,368 --> 01:36:35,327
That's Altair-4,
the bright speck below the star.

1270
01:36:37,341 --> 01:36:38,638
Fifteen seconds.

1271
01:36:42,513 --> 01:36:46,950
Yes, Alta, your father,
my shipmates...

1272
01:36:47,017 --> 01:36:48,985
all the stored knowledge
of the Krell.

1273
01:36:50,154 --> 01:36:52,850
Five seconds, four...

1274
01:36:52,923 --> 01:36:56,086
three, two, one...

1275
01:37:07,471 --> 01:37:12,602
Alta, about a million years
from now the human race...

1276
01:37:12,676 --> 01:37:16,168
will have crawled up
to where the Krell stood...

1277
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:20,308
in their great moment
of triumph and tragedy.

1278
01:37:25,789 --> 01:37:28,986
And your father's name
will shine again...

1279
01:37:29,059 --> 01:37:31,050
like a beacon in the galaxy.

1280
01:37:32,796 --> 01:37:37,495
It's true, it will remind us...

1281
01:37:37,568 --> 01:37:39,866
that we are, after all, not God.
